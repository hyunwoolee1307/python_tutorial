<div><p>Title: Interactions Among the Western North Pacific Subtropical High, Indian Summer Monsoon, and East Asia Summer Monsoon: Implications for East Asia Summer Monsoon</p><p>Abstract<br>The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system is modulated by large-scale circulation features that originate in the Indian and western North Pacific basins, notably the Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH) and the interface between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and EASM. This synthesis integrates evidence from multiple studies to elucidate (i) how WNPSH variability links the strength and regional rainfall distribution of the EASM, (ii) how the Indian monsoon–East Asian monsoon interaction modulates the WNPSH and moisture transport toward East Asia, and (iii) how interannual to decadal variability in the WNPSH and ISM–EASM coupling affects East Asia summer rainfall patterns. We emphasize mechanisms (Rossby wave trains, moisture advection, jet and anticyclone adjustments, and teleconnections) supported by diverse observational and modeling studies.</p><ol start="1"><li>The WNPSH as a central modulator of East Asia summer rainfall and the EASM<br><ul><li>The Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH) exerts strong control on East Asian summer monsoon circulation through its intensity, position, and associated moisture fluxes.

The ISM–EASM coupling, modulated by Tibetan Plateau warming, Rossby wave dynamics, and regional moisture transport, shapes the WNPSH’s intensity and position, thereby controlling East Asia summer rainfall distribution. Short-timescale oscillations (QBWO, ISO) act as amplifiers or modulators of this system, influencing the seasonal evolution and intraseasonal variability of EASM. Efficient prediction and understanding of East Asia summer rainfall thus require integrated representations of WNPSH dynamics, ISM–EASM coupling, and their coupled wave-transport pathways, as
